# Text Gates

Is a hardware def language designed to glue logic gates togeather and allow for using "functions" to compose complex behavures from creating subcircuits 


## Goals
- Design
  - Be able to compose many gates into sub systems
- Simulation
   - Execute a text gate file
- Visulisation
  - Use mermaid to render a visulisation of the logic gate connections
